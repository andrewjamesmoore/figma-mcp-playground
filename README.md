## Documentation: Figma MCP Server and Code Connect

> **Overview**
> 
> This projects aims to create a MVP design system using Figma Variables and Components. It then connects to a code base using Claude Code and Figma's MCP server. Using Code Connect we should be able to document our code in design and vice versa. We should also be able to use Claude code, provide it context, and create new components from the Figma designs using our declared variables and components.
